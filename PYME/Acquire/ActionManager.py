    different tasks can be asigned different priorities, with higher priority 
    tasks bubbling up and and being executed before lower priority tasks. This 
    allows high priority "imaging" tasks to be inserted into a stream of lower
    priority "monitoring" tasks if something interesting is detected during 
    monitoring.
    
    An individual action is a function which can be found within the scope of
    our microscope object (for more details see the QueueAction method).

        Parameters

            The name of a function relative to the microscope object.
            e.g. to `call scope.spoolController.start_spooling()`, you would use
            a functionName of 'spoolController.start_spooling'.
            
            The function should either return `None` if the operation has already
            completed, or function which evaluates to True once the operation
            has completed. See `scope.spoolController.start_spooling()` for an
            example.
            
        args : dict
            a dictionary of arguments to pass the function    
        nice : int (or float)
            The priority with which to execute the function. Functions with a
            lower nice value execute first. Nice should have a value between 0 and 20. nice=20 is reserved by convention
            for tidy-up tasks which should run
            after all other tasks and put the microscope in a 'safe' state.
        timeout : float
            A timeout in seconds from the current time at which the action
            becomes irrelevant and should be ignored.
        max_duration : float
            A generous estimate, in seconds, of how long the task might take, 
            after which the lasers will be automatically turned off and the 
            action queue paused. This will not interrupt the current task, 
            though it has presumably already failed at that point. Intended as a
            safety feature for automated acquisitions, the check is every 3 s 
            rather than fine-grained.
        execute_after: float
            A timestamp in system time before which the action should not be executed.
            If this is before the current time, the action will be queued for immediate
            execution, otherwise it will be placed in a queue of scheduled acquisitions
            which is polled by the Tick() method and added to the execution queue when
            the time is right. The default of 0 means that the action will be queued for

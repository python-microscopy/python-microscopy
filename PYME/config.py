"""
Support for configuration / settings in PYME. This will eventually replace a motley collection of different ways of
storing the configuration in use in different parts of PYME. Configuration is read from the following locations (if they exist)
which are searched in order, with later entries over-riding prior ones:

 - an ``etc/PYME`` directory under the python ``sys.prefix``. This would usually be ``/usr/local/`` under standard unix
   python and the distribution base directory for a distribution such as anaconda. This allows installation wide
   configuration and is also a place that should be writable when installing conda packages and the like (useful for
   writing a package with plugins which register themselves - see plugin functions below.
 - a machine wide ``/etc/PYME`` directory. This is included for compatibility, but it is not envisaged that this will be used often, as it will only work on posix
   systems while the the above ``{{sys.prefix}}/etc/PYME`` option will also work under windows.
 - a ``.PYME`` directory under the users home directory. This should be used for user specific settings.

Within each configuration directory there can be a ``config.yaml`` file which stores configuration settings as key-value
pairs. These are accessed using the :func:`get` function.

The directories may also contain a ``plugins`` folder, which in turn can contain subfolders for ``visgui``, ``dsviewer``,
and ``recipes``.  PYME will also detect custom acquisition protocols saved in the ``.PYME/protocols`` directory,
similarly init scripts will be detected in ``.PYME/init_scripts`` directory. The
overall template for a configuration directory is as follows: ::

    .PYME
      |- config.yaml
      |- plugins
      |     |- visgui
      |     |     |- somemodule.txt
      |     |     |- anothermodule.txt
      |     |
      |     |- dsviewer
      |     |     |- somemodule.txt
      |     |
      |     |- recipes
      |     |      |- anothermodule.txt
      |     |
      |     |- reports
      |     |      |- somemodule.txt
      |     |
      |     |- <plugin-name>.yaml
      |     |- <another-plugin-name>.yaml
      |
      |- protocols
      |     |- a_protocol.py
      |     |- another_protocol.py
      |
      |- customrecipes
      |     |- myrecipe.yaml
      |     |- myOtherRecipe.yaml
      |
      |- init_scripts
      |     |- init_mymachine.py
      |     |- init_my_other_config.py
      |
      |- chained_analyisis
      |     |-analysis_rule_chain.yaml
      |
      |- cameras
      |     |- bunch_of_cams.yaml
      |     |- single_cam.yaml
      |     |- my_other_cam.yaml
            
If you want to verify which directories will be searched on your particular python installation, running the following
on the command line will tell you:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -c "import PYME.config;print PYME.config.config_dirs"
    
with anaconda on OSX this gives me:

.. code-block:: bash

    ['/Users/david/.PYME', '/etc/PYME', '/Users/david/anaconda/etc/PYME']

Examples
========

config.yaml
-----------

The config.yaml file is essentially nothing more than a set of keys and values separated by colons. List and dictionary
parameter values are supported using standard yaml notation.

.. code-block:: yaml

    dataserver-root: "/Users/david/srvtest/test1"
    h5f-flush_interval: 1
    PYMEAcquire-extra_init_dir: "C:/pyme-init-scripts"



plugins/visgui/<plugin_name>.txt, plugins/dsview/<plugin_name>.txt, plugins/recipes/<plugin_name>.txt
-----------------------
If we were to use the plugin architecture to register some of the native visgui plugins (rather than using explicit
knowledge of their locations), the registration file would look something like this. Each line is a fully qualified
module import path.

::

    PYME.LMVis.Extras.photophysics
    PYME.LMVis.Extras.particleTracking

The same structure holds for dh5view plugins and dsview/<plugin_name>.txt and recipes/<plugin_name>.txt. NOTE - this
method of plugiin registration is supported for backwards compatibility only - new plugins should drop as single
<plugin-name>.yaml config file as detailed below.


plugins/<plugin-name>.yaml
--------------------------

A yaml file containing plugin information. This supersedes the previous separate plugin directories outlined above.
It should be formatted according to the following example. All sections are optional and may be omitted if the plugin
doesn't supply the features in question:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # a list of fully qualified module import paths for VisGUI plugins
    visgui:
        - somepackage.somemodule
        - somepackage.anothermodule
        
    # a list of fully qualified import paths for dh5view plugins
    dsviewer:
        - somepackage.somemodule
        
    # a list of fully qualified import paths for recipe modules
    recipes:
        - somepackage.somemodule
    
    # a list of fully qualified import paths for fitfactories
    fit_factories:
        - somepackage.somemodule
        
    # a section detailing templates and filters for jinga2 generated reports
    reports:
        # an importable module containing the templates
        # the module is just used to get the file path (i.e. we do `os.path.join(os.path.dirname(somemodule), template_name)`)
        # this module will get imported every time anything in PYME runs, so please make it lightweight (i.e. an
        # empty __init__.py in a dedicated templates folder which only has templates as the other contents)
        templates: somepackage.somemodule
        
        # jinga2 filters. Note that these will need to be pre-fixed by the plugin name when used in templates
        # to avoid name collisions with builtin filters or those from other plugins ie {{ value | myplugin.myfilter }}
        filters:
            somepackage.somemodule:
                - filter1
                - filter2
            somepagage.anothermodule:
                -filter3
                
    config:
        # any plugin specific config / settings which you want to put here - just a placeholder for now, but an implicit
        # promise that we won't clobber this key in the future.
        
    

In addition to the configuration derived from config.yaml, a few legacy environment variables are recognized. Subpackages
are also permitted to save configuration files in the ``.PYME`` directory.

Functions
=========


Known Config Keys
=================

This is a non-exhaustive list of configuration keys - if adding a new key, please add it here.

.. csv-table:: Config keys
    :header: Key, Default, Description
    :widths: auto

    PYMEAcquire-extra_init_dir, default=None, a path to an extra directory to search for PYMEAcquire init files.

    SplitterRatioDatabase,  default=None, path to a .json formatted file containing information about ratiometric splitting ratios

    VisGUI-console-startup-file,  default=None, "path to a script to run within the VisGUI interactive console on startup,
    used to populate the console namespace with additional functions. Note that this script should not manipulate the
    pipeline as this cannot be assumed to be loaded when the script runs."
        
    dh5View-console-startup-file,  default=None,  "path to a script to run within the dh5View interactive console on startup,
    used to populate the console namespace with additional functions. Note that this script should not manipulate the
    data as this cannot be assumed to be loaded when the script runs."

    TaskServer.process_queues_in_order,  default = True, "an optimisation for old style task distribution so that it processes
    series in the order that they were added to the queue (rather than the previous approach of choosing from a series
    at random). Means that caches behave sensibly, rather than potentially getting scrambled when multiple analyses run
    at once, but also means that you need to wait for previous series to finish before you get any results from the
    current series if you are doing real time analysis and not keeping up."

    dataserver-root, None, "what directory should PYMEDataSever serve. Overridden by the `--root` command line option. If undefined,
    the current directory is served. Note that this is also used in `clusterIO` to allow short-circuit access to data on
    the same node."
        
    dataserver-filter, default = '', "multi-cluster support. Specifies a cluster name / clusterfilter which identifies which
    cluster PYMEDataServer should identify with. First part of the PYME-CLUSTER url. Overridden by the `--server-filter`
    command line option."

    dataserver-port, default=8080, what port to run the PYMEDataServer on. Overridden by the --port command line option (e.g. if you want to run multiple servers on one machine).

    cluster-listing-no-countdir, default=False, "hack to disable (True) the loading of the low-level countdir module which allows rapid
    directory statistics on posix systems. Needed on OSX if `dataserver-root` is a mapped network drive rather than a
    physical disk"

    clusterIO-hybridns, default=True, "toggles whether a protocol compatibility 
    nameserver (True) or zeroconf only (False) is used in clusterIO. The hybrid
    nameserver offers greater protocol/version compatibility but is effectively
    two nameservers, which has performance implications on very high bandwidth 
    systems."

    h5r-flush_interval, default=1, "how often (in s) should we call the .flush() method and write records from the HDF/pytables
    caches to disk when writing h5r files."

    nodeserver-chunksize, default=50, "how many frames should we give a worker process at once (larger numbers = better
    background cache performance, but potentially not distributing as widely). Should be larger than the number of
    background frames when doing running average / percentile background subtraction [new style distribution]."

    nodeserver-worker-get-timeout, default=60, "a timeout (in s). When the worker asks for tasks, the nodeserver tries to
    get nodeserver-chunksize tasks off its internal queue (which is filled by a separate thread which communicates with
    the ruleserver). This timeout specifies how long should the nodeserver wait when accessing this queue in the hope of
    finding a full chunk. If it times out, a partial chunk will be given to the worker. In practice, this timeout
    behaviour is responsible for clearing the small tail of tasks at the end of a series. [new-style distribution]."

    nodeserver-num_workers, default= CPU count, Number of workers to launch on an individual node.

    ruleserver-retries, default = 3, [new-style task distribution]. The number of times to retry a given task before it is deemed to have failed.

    rulenodeserver-nonlocal, default = True, "Whether to bid for non-local tasks if no local tasks are found. Disabling
    non-local bidding (setting this to False) will make task distribution less robust, but is potentially a viable
    workarond if trying to e.g. run recipes which use stupid ammounts of memory and will crash when run non-locally.
    The need for this should be removed by better recipe costing."

    httpspooler-chunksize, default=50, "how many frames we spool in each chunk 
    before (potentially) switching which PYMEDataServer we send the next chunk
    to. Increasing the chunksize can increase data-locality for faster analysis,
    but has spooling/writing bandwidth implications."

    pymevis-zoom-factor, default = 1.1, adjusts zoom sensitivity by adjusting magnification factor per scroll event


Deprecated config options
-------------------------

distributor-* : parameters for a previous implementation of cluster-based task distribution. Largely irrelevant now we use PYMERuleServer

VisGUI-new_layers : default = True, use the new-style layers view in VisGUI. Same as the --new_layers command line option.
    Largely a remnant of when I was running layers and old style VisGUI in parallel.

    (https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/) or write our own.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fn : string
        Path to a yaml file.
    d : dict
        key, value pairs of keys/values to update or append to the
        end of the file
    create_backup : bool
        Make a backup of the YAML file before updating the keys
    """
    import re
    import json

    if create_backup:
        import shutil
        shutil.copy(fn, fn+'.bak')

    # Read the yaml file
    with open(fn) as f:
        data = f.read()

    # Update the appropriate keys
    for k, v in d.items():
        x = re.search(r'^{}\s*:.*$'.format(k),data,flags=re.MULTILINE)
        if isinstance(v, str):
            v_s = '\'' + v + '\''
        else:
            v_s = json.dumps(v)
        
        if x is None:
            data += '\n{}: {}'.format(k, v_s)
        else:
            data = re.sub(r'^{}\s*:.*$'.format(k),
                          lambda m: '{}: {}'.format(k,v_s),data,flags=re.MULTILINE)

    # Update the yaml file

    Parameters
    ----------
    d : dict
        Dictionary of configuration keys to update
    config : str, optional
        PYME configuration type, one of ['user','site','dist'], by default 'user'
    config_fn : str, optional
        Name of the configuration file within the type, by default 'config.yaml'
    create_backup : bool
        Create a backup of the configuration file before updating.

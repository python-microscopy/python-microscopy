PYME (the PYthon Microscopy Environment) is an open-source application suite for light microscopy acquisition, data storage, visualization, and analysis. It offers a particularly comprehensive set of features for single-molecule localization techniques (PALM, STORM, PAINT, etc ...), but also supports many other modalities. The package is multi-platform, running on Windows, Linux, and OSX.

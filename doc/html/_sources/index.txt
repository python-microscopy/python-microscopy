PYME's Documentation
====================

Thank you for your interest in PYME. I'll be the first to admit that the documentation 
could use a lot of work, but this takes time and I hope there is enough here to get you started. Some
aspects are currently pretty specific to our internal workflows, but I have left
them in in the hope that they are nonetheless useful. The documentation is aimed
at end users, with a reasonably modest level of computer ability, and there is
currently no API documentation. If you want to extend or otherwise hack PYME I'd 
recommend getting in touch with me and I'll tell you what bits of the API are
fairly mature, what is on the TODO list for restructuring, and what is deprecated.
I might even be persuaded to write some more docs.

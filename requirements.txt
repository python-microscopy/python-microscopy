# These support functionality which is not core

# django is used for the full-blown clusterUI (see cluster analysis docs) but is not required for most analysis tasks. Don't install by default as backwards
# compatibility between django versions is not great and it's hard to keep this tracking the latest security fixes. Installing a (potentially old and insecure)
# version of django should be a deliberate choice.
